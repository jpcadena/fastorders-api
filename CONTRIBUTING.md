## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have cloned the repository. This will allow you to make and test your changes before pushing them for consideration.
2. Create a New Branch: Before you begin making changes, create a new branch for your work. This helps in isolating your feature or bugfix from the main codebase, making it easier to review and merge your contributions. Name your branch according to the feature you're working on or the bug you're fixing.

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature
   ```

   or if you're fixing a bug:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b bugfix/DescribeTheBug
   ```

3. Make Your Changes: After creating your branch, you can start making changes to the code. Ensure you're following our coding standards and guidelines for a smooth review process.

4. Commit Your Changes: Once you're satisfied with your changes, commit them to your branch. Be sure to write a clear and concise commit message, explaining what you've done and why.

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "A brief description of the changes"
   ```

5. Push Your Branch: After committing your changes, push your branch to the remote repository.

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/AmazingFeature
   ```

## Code Style

We follow the [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) style guide for Python code. Please ensure your contributions adhere to this standard.

We recommend using a linter to check your code quality. You can check the documentation for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/linting#_linting) or [JetBrains PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/using-docstrings-to-specify-types.html) for more information.

For autocompletion, we recommend the [TabNine](https://www.tabnine.com/install) plugin.

## Documentation

When adding new code, please use docstring with **reStructuredText** format by adding triple double quotes **"""** after function definition. Add a brief function description, also for the parameters including the return value and its corresponding data type.

## Pre-commit Checks

Before committing your code, you must have `make` installed on your system. For Windows users, we recommend using [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/), a package manager that simplifies the process of installing and managing software.

To install Chocolatey, open an administrative PowerShell and execute:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
```

After installing Chocolatey, you can install `make` by running:

```powershell
choco install make
```

Once `make` is installed, you can run the following command in the root of your project to execute the checks defined in the `Makefile`:

```bash
make check
```

Please ensure that all checks pass before submitting a pull request.

## Commit Messages

Please use clear and meaningful commit messages. This helps us understand the changes you've made and the reasoning behind them. If your commit resolves a specific issue, reference it in your commit message.

### Structured Commit Messages

To maintain a clear and consistent commit history, we follow a structured format for our commit messages based on [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). The format is as follows:

```bash
[type](reach): [description]
```

- **type**: This indicates the nature of the change. Valid types include `add`, `cut`, `fix`, `bump`, `make`, `start`, `stop`, `refactor`, `reformat`, `optimize`, `document`.
- **scope**: This specifies where the change was made, for example, `database layer`, `UI`, or `API`.
- **description**: A brief, imperative summary of the change.

#### Example

```bash
fix(database layer): use async session for performance improvement
```

## Pull Requests

1. Commit your changes to your branch.

   ```bash
   git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'
   ```

2. Push your branch to your fork of the repository on GitHub.

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/AmazingFeature
   ```

3. Open a Pull Request from your fork to our repository. Please provide a detailed explanation of your changes and reference any related issues.
